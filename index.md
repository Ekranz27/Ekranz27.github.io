### CPSC 120L

* Lab 6 Part 2

  What I liked about this lab was that it was a struggle to figure it out. My partner and I worked very hard to figure out this code and when we did the relief we felt after seeing the "all tests passed" come up was astounding. It was really my first lab that was a struggle and made me think how to logically work through a problem in my code.

* Lab 9 Part 1

  This lab was had a lot of things going on in it. For this lab we had to take the numbers from the command line and use them to calculate average Olympian scores which I found was really interesting to know that is how they score in the Olympics.

* Lab 10 Part 1

  Lab 10 was a different and unique program, because although I'm sure other people already have a program to indentify prime numbers, creating one was pretty interesting. It showed me that sometimes you have to use a lot of commands on one variable to get it to work the way you want was a cool learning moment.
